            I am a student at the University of Cincinnati studying computer engineering. In my free time I like to design circuits and program, both on low level microcontrollers and high level user space applications. I have a range of experience through my COOPs that encompasses embedded development and front-end web development. Right now I'm working on finishing my bachelors in Computer Engineering.
            <h4>Work Experience</h4>
            <p>
Company: Regal Beloit Corp.
Term: Fall 2017 - Spring 2018
Role: Electrical Engineering COOP

I was a developer for the bootloader and kernel for a new motor operating system. The main project I was asssigned to was running the microcontroller on the motor on as low of power as possible and implementing methods to secure the microcontroller and related binaries from unwanted adversaries. I implemented in-house encryption algorithms and developed secure binary formats to do this. The main tools I used at this COOP were IAR, C, C++, and ARMv7 assembly. I consider the bootloader and kernel a success because they were completed and functional by the end of my COOP.

Company: Worldpay
Term: Summer 2018 - Summer 2019 (ongoing)
Role: Software Engineering COOP

At Worldpay I started out as a front-end web developer for C# MVC. Shortly after showing technical proficiency in this, I was transferred to another team to work on a prototype in-house software to simplify a long process used to provide payouts to customers. Ultimately I finished this prototype and it was used while I was away at school to get shareholders to agree to fund this project. After I came back, I was a lead developer on this project and helped lead a team of developers. The project when I came back was behind schedule, and a week before I left, it was ahead of schedule. The main tools I used for this were Visual Studio 2012 and 2017 and C# MVC.
