      Welcome to my programming portfolio. At the top bar there are many interesting things to explore. This website recently now uses nginx for the web server. Most of the examples and syntax highlighting engine use JavaScript, and everything aside from the web server are made from scratch. I suggest checking out the in-browser examples because they are very cool.
